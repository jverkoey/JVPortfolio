<h1>WWDC 2008</h1>

<h2>My application letter</h2>

<div class="explanation">

<p>What follows is my application letter and a snippet taken from my blog post originally
dated May 5, 2008.</p>

<p>The WWDC (World-Wide Developer's Conference) is an event hosted by Apple that offers
over 150 seminars relating to OS X and the iPhone. In the past, the conference has had
over 5000 attendees, over 1000 Apple software engineers, and a keynote by Steve Jobs
among other notable events. This year, those numbers will only witness an increase in
number and Steve Jobs' keynote will likely reveal the long-awaited App Store for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Each year the WWDC grants a small number of scholarships to students. This year,
there are 400 scholarships available, each worth approximately $1300 USD. I have just
recently received news that I have received one such scholarship and will be attending
the conference in San Francisco this June.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose this major?</h3>

<p>Eight years have passed since I wrote my first line of code on the TI83+. Since that day
I have had an unending passion for software development which has led naturally to pursuing
a degree in Computer Science. I chose my major to better understand the theoretical backbone
of software development and broaden my understanding of a variety of related fields.</p>

<h3>What work experience did you find the most fulfilling and why?</h3>

<p>The University of Waterloo offers a strong co-op program which allowed me to dedicate
three four-month work terms at Sony Creative Software. During my employment as a software
developer I was privileged to develop several key features for shipping products. One such
product was Photo Go!.</p>

<p>My involvement with Photo Go! involved implementing printing, photo editing and
full-screen slideshow features that involved a large amount of UI design and
implementation. I also developed a custom tree view control that provided the user with
intuitive feedback for drag-and-drop actions by intelligently highlighting the nodes
that could support the data type being dragged. This line of work was very fulfilling
and has allowed me to grow a passion for intelligent user interface design and
implementations.</p>

<h3>If you have not attended before, please describe your reasons for wanting to attend
the conference.</h3>

<p>Attending WWDC 2008 will allow me, as a new OS X software developer, to gain valuable
insights into developing for both OS X and the iPhone. I wish to attend the conference
in order to strengthen my knowledge about the development practices for Cocoa and
Objective-C 2.0. Also, as a Windows developer with over five years of experience I
have a solid background in software development that will aid me in absorbing as much
information at WWDC as possible.</p>

<h3>What type of development work do you do?</h3>

<p>A large proportion of my spare time is devoted to game development. As a hobbyist
game developer I have created eight demos that have received recognition in game design
competitions. My current project is a light-weight cross-platform framework that I intend
on using to port my games to OS X and other platforms. Already, I have a variety of demos
that function on both Windows and OS X.</p>

<p>I also have experience in web-page design involving PHP and MySQL. I strongly believe
that, as an independent software developer, it is crucial to be able to design a
functional website that advertises my skills. As such, I have created numerous sites
both from the ground up and as modifications to existing systems.</p>

<h3>What are your career plans? Are you considering a career in software or
hardware development?</h3>

<p>As an experienced software developer I intend on further exploring the realm
of software development both professionally and independently. The coming two years of
my life are devoted to education and co-op, and so I will be focusing heavily on gathering
a large set of skills from a variety of companies through co-op while learning about a
diverse set of Psychology, Computer Science, and Mathematics. After graduating, I intend
on pulling together a small team of strong developers and designers and starting a game
development studio.</p>
